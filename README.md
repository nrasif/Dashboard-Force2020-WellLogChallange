# Force 2020 Well Log Challange Dashboard
## What is this?
This is a web app consisting of a dashboard with data from [FORCE 2020: Well Log Challange](https://xeek.ai/challenges/force-well-logs/overview). The dashboard is intended to display well log analysis, including its distribution based on log parameters, lithology, or the position of the well. Spearman rank correlation was also shown to analyze the relationship between well log parameters for machine learning pre-processing.

## About the app
The dashboard app was made entirely with Python. You can access and play the plot through the link [here](https://force2020-dash.herokuapp.com). I also created a whole guide for this dashboard app in my [Medium article](https://medium.com/@naharirasif/a-concise-guide-to-plotly-and-dash-for-well-log-dashboard-ad86b8f5c615)

## Requirements
It's recommended to have Python +3.4. This app was built using Python 3.9.7.
